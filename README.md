# Slightly76 Does NC News (by [Chris Askew](mailto:caskew@hotmail.com) )

    Welcome to Slightly76 Does NC News, a single-page application built in JavaScvript with React, CSS andpSQL that mimics a large, popular social media site. It is designed, with Mobile in mind, to provide users with an intuitive experience for browsing articles and interacting with them in various ways. It's hosted on Supabase, Render and Netlify and is my first 'live' coding project of the modern age.
